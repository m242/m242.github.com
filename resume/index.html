				<h1>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</h1>
				<h6>Arthur C. Clarke</h6>
				
				<p>
					My two daughters are going to grow up in a world where the sum of all human knowledge
					is available in the palm of their hand. They can instantly communicate across the globe
					within the span of a few milliseconds. This magic box in the palm of their hand is
					orders of magnitude faster than the Commodore 64 I had as a child, and more orders of
					magnitude faster than the house-sized computer their grandfather programmed with punch
					cards.
				</p>
				
				<p><em>And we're just getting started.</em></p>
				
				<p>
					In the past 18 years, I've seen the Internet change from dialup PPP and UUCP
					connections to an all-encompassing part of the human condition, from server-side Javascript
					called Netscape Livewire to server-side Javascript called Node.js (history, even in tech,
					repeats itself). "Being online" used to
					be an action that you took during the day, for an hour or two. Today, it's exactly the
					opposite &mdash; you "disconnect" for a short period of time. The next 20 years hold
					such an incredible, unpredictable amount of progress, and I can't wait to see them.

					<li> Architect the overall web infrastructure from top to bottom, including

				<p>
					Currently, my team designs, develops, and maintains the domestic and international

					having "upgraded" from Java in 2011. Additionally, we are now designing for mobile
					first, with Skechers web traffic going from 7% mobile to over 32% mobile within the
					past two years.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					I'm very proud of the team that I've assembled; we are extremely nimble, and very
					efficient at coming up with solutions for other departments &mdash; our clients.
					We have a unified build process with great automated test coverage, and a one-button
					deployment from environment to environment to help catch the relatively small amount
					of bugs that leak out. We consistently score extremely high in customer satisfaction
					and site usability, and the third-party usability firm we engage is consistently
					impressed with our design and overall application speed.

					<li> Support existing clients, market to prospective new clients, and oversee P&amp;L for the
						business. </li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					The new version of Heluna launched to existing clients in November of 2012, with the general
					rollout in January 2013. It is a self-service, extremely low maintenance web application that
					provides small to medium businesses with spam filtering without the need to purchase specific
					hardware or be in the business of filtering spam e-mails. The application is written in Scala
					with heavy Akka usage, and the website uses the Play! framework, all tied back to a CouchDB
					NoSQL database. It is deployed on AWS.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The knowledge I've gained from running Heluna has been immeasurable,
					and the architecture, design, marketing, and development experience it has given me is second
					to none. It's exciting to get feedback from clients saying that they wouldn't know what they'd
					do without Heluna, and their questions and input have given me a great amount of visibility
					into running in a startup environment.

					</p>
					
					<p>
						After WoW was launched, my team worked on extremely-high-trafficked custom content

					The ROSS project at Warner Music Group was a multimillion dollar content management system

				<p>
					The CMS was primarily designed around XML and XSLT, and the developers and designers did
					a fantastic job creating different websites based off the same datafeeds from the main

					I'm lucky to have worked alongside Netscape so early on; at EmeraldNet, we helped create the very

				<h3>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/m242">@m242</a></h3>
				<p>
					Twitter has taken on a
					cultural identity rivaled only by the web &mdash; in its infancy &mdash; itself.
					Where having a URL alongside marketing used to be novel, now everything has
					a hashtag. Twitter is the perfect balance between quick consumption, and a
					pointer to the best content online.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span6">
				<h3>Flickr: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mark242/">mark242</a></h3>
				<p>
					An incredible service that fell out of favor, and now is back in favor thanks
					to an incredible iPhone app. One of the classic stories of a large company not
					knowing the jewel it had on its hands. Flickr is where our family stores all 
					of our photos offsite, and is a great example of a service just done well.

				<h3>Stellar: <a href="http://stellar.io/mark242">mark242</a></h3>
				<p>
					Stellar is what the Twitter Discover tab needs to be. It adds so much to Twitter
					that I can't imagine using Twitter without Stellar. I find more interesting things
					on Twitter, Flickr, Youtube, and so on, on Stellar than I do almost anywhere else.
					It's absolutely invaluable.

				<h3>Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/markrbeeson">markrbeeson</a></h3>
				<p>
					Matt Haughey wrote a great article, <a href="https://medium.com/i-m-h-o/52a20d7a17de">"Why
					I love Twitter and barely tolerate Facebook"</a>, that I agree with almost in its entirety.
					Facebook serves as a replacement for those end-of-year summary letters that people send
					with their holiday cards. I tend to think it will have a limited lifespan.

				<h3>Github: <a href="https://github.com/m242">m242</a></h3>
				<p>
					I don't have a lot of public repositories in Github, simply because I haven't had much
					time to correctly decouple potentially open source work. Hopefully that will change.
					We're using Github and Hudson at Skechers for all of our new work; it's a huge timesaver
					in our build process.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="span6">
				<h3>Foursquare: <a href="https://foursquare.com/m242">m242</a></h3>
				<p>
					I'm still trying to figure out why I like Foursquare so much. I think it's because it's
					one of those ideas that personifies what the 21st century is about &mdash; identifying
					yourself with a place in such a way that you never could before. Foursquare is social
					in a way unlike any other application.
